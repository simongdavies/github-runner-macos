# GitHub Actions Runner Wrapper
#
# Purpose: Restart ./run.sh in an infinite loop with backoff, and handle
# graceful shutdown on SIGTERM. This is a crash-recovery wrapper only.
# Post-job cleanup is handled via ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_COMPLETED in .env.
#
# Usage: github-runner-wrapper.sh <runner-dir>
#
# Example:
#   github-runner-wrapper.sh "$HOME/github-runner-1"
#   github-runner-wrapper.sh "$HOME/github-runner-2"
#
# Install as a launchd service via the corresponding .plist file.
