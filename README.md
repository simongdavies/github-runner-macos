# macOS GitHub Actions Runner Setup

This repo automates GitHub Actions runner setup on macOS (Apple Silicon). It supports **two types** of runner that can run side by side. The key difference is the **capability** each one offers a job — what it can do, and whether it is isolated from the host. Both clean up after every job:

1. **macOS / AVF runners** — jobs run on macOS itself, which exposes Apple's **Virtualization.framework (AVF)** to the job. Jobs are **not isolated from the host**: although we wipe each runner's `_work` directory after every job, anything a job writes outside `_work` (Homebrew packages, global caches, `/tmp`, login items, keychains, etc.) persists and is visible to later jobs and to the machine.
2. **Ubuntu / KVM runners** — jobs run inside a throwaway Ubuntu 24.04 VM (via [Tart](https://tart.run)) which exposes **nested KVM** to the job. The VM is destroyed after a single job, so every job gets a clean environment that is **fully isolated from the host**, and workloads that need `/dev/kvm` (e.g. nested virtualization) just work. See [Ubuntu / KVM Runners](#ubuntu--kvm-runners).

> **Why two types? AVF vs KVM.** What we'd *ideally* want is isolated guest
> VMs for both worlds: a **macOS guest exposing AVF** and a **Linux guest
> exposing KVM**, so every job is sandboxed regardless of which virtualization
> stack it needs. We can't have that — because Apple only exposes the hardware
> virtualization extensions to **Linux** guests (nested virt is M3/M4 + macOS
> 15+, **Linux guests only**). A virtualized **macOS** guest gets *no* virt
> extensions, so it can't expose AVF. There's no isolated-VM option for the
> AVF/macOS side, so we have to **compromise there**:
>
> - **AVF (macOS):** since AVF can't be exposed inside a guest, the job runs on
>   the **macOS host** → **macOS / AVF runners**, with **no host
>   isolation.** (This is the compromise.)
> - **KVM (Linux):** the job runs inside an isolated Linux VM that *is* handed
>   hardware virtualization → **Ubuntu / KVM runners** (arm64 Linux guests
>   only), **fully isolated from the host**.

## Requirements

- **Apple Silicon only.** This repo targets arm64 Macs (M-series); Intel/x64 is
  not supported.
- **macOS:** the macOS / AVF runners run on any reasonably current macOS. The
  Ubuntu / KVM runners need **macOS 15 (Sequoia)+ on M3/M4** — see that
  section's [Requirements](#requirements).
- The Mac must reach GitHub over outbound HTTPS on port 443.

# macOS / AVF Runners

The GitHub Actions agent runs directly on macOS, so jobs get access to Apple's
Virtualization.framework (AVF). These runners are **persistent** and **not
isolated from the host** (see the trade-off note at the top).

These runners:
- download and extract the GitHub runner package
- create numbered runner directories from a prefix
- configure each runner against a repo or org
- run them under launchd with restart behavior
- clean each runner work directory after every job (this clears `_work` only — it does **not** isolate jobs from the rest of the host)

## Scripts

- `bootstrap-gh-runners.sh`: creates directories, downloads runner binaries, extracts, and runs `config.sh` in unattended mode.
- `github-runner-wrapper.sh`: crash-recovery wrapper around `run.sh` (restart-on-crash, graceful SIGTERM, keeps the Mac awake).
- `github-runner-cleanup.sh`: canonical post-job cleanup hook; copied into each runner directory and wired up via `ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_COMPLETED` to wipe `_work` after every job.
- launchd plists are generated automatically by bootstrap when using `--install-launchd`.

## 1) Get Setup Values from GitHub UI

In your repository or organization:
1. Go to Settings -> Actions -> Runners.
2. Click New self-hosted runner.
3. Select macOS and the correct architecture for your Mac.
4. Copy the URL target and registration token shown by GitHub.

Important:
- Do not commit tokens to git.
- If a token expires, generate a new one and rerun bootstrap.

## 2) One Command: Bootstrap + Hook Env + launchd

Recommended (LaunchDaemon mode, starts at boot without login):

```bash
sudo bash bootstrap-gh-runners.sh \
  --dir-prefix "$HOME/github-runner" \
  --count 3 \
  --org your-org \
  --token "YOUR_REGISTRATION_TOKEN" \
  --replace \
  --install-launchd \
  --launchd-scope daemon \
  --launchd-user "$USER"
```

User based (LaunchAgent mode, starts after user login):

```bash
bash bootstrap-gh-runners.sh \
  --dir-prefix "$HOME/github-runner" \
  --count 3 \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --token "YOUR_REGISTRATION_TOKEN" \
  --replace \
  --install-launchd \
  --launchd-scope agent
```

What this creates:
- $HOME/github-runner-1
- $HOME/github-runner-2
- $HOME/github-runner-3

Common flags:
- --labels <csv>: Optional custom labels (e.g. `mini` or `hvf` where supported). GitHub automatically adds `self-hosted`, `macOS`, and `ARM64`; do not repeat them here.
- --runner-group <name>: Org or enterprise runner group.
- --name-prefix <prefix>: Base name for runners.
- --token-file <path>: Read the registration token from a file instead of `--token` (keeps the secret out of shell history and the process list).
- --force-recreate: Deletes existing directories before reinstall.
- --install-launchd: Installs/reloads launchd services for all runners 1..N.
- --launchd-scope <agent|daemon>: launchd domain (`agent` requires login, `daemon` starts at boot).
- --launchd-user <user>: account used by daemon mode (`UserName` in plist).
- --launchd-dir <dir>: launchd plist directory override.
- --launchd-label-prefix <prefix>: Custom launchd label prefix (default: com.github.runner).
- --launch-agents-dir <dir>: Back-compat alias for `--launchd-dir`.
- --version x.y.z: Pins runner version instead of latest.

Incremental behavior:
- If prefix-1 and prefix-2 already exist and are configured, and you run with --count 3, the script skips existing configured directories and ensures services 1..3 are installed/reloaded.
- It also ensures ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_COMPLETED is present in each runner .env and writes job-completed-hook.sh.

## 3) Verify

LaunchDaemon mode:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do
  sudo launchctl print system/com.github.runner-${i} >/dev/null 2>&1 \
    && echo "runner-${i}: loaded" \
    || echo "runner-${i}: missing"
done
```

LaunchAgent mode:

```bash
launchctl list com.github.runner-1
launchctl list com.github.runner-2
launchctl list com.github.runner-3
```

Expected in runner terminal/logs after startup:
- Connected to GitHub
- Listening for Jobs

## OPS (macOS / AVF runners)

LaunchDaemon mode:

```bash
# Status summary
for i in 1 2 3; do
  sudo launchctl print system/com.github.runner-${i} >/dev/null 2>&1 \
    && echo "runner-${i}: loaded" \
    || echo "runner-${i}: missing"
done

# Full status for one runner
sudo launchctl print system/com.github.runner-1

# Tail logs
tail -f ~/.github-runner-logs/runner-1-stdout.log
tail -f ~/.github-runner-logs/runner-1-stderr.log
tail -f ~/github-runner-1/.cleanup.log

# Tail all three stdout logs
tail -f ~/.github-runner-logs/runner-1-stdout.log \
        ~/.github-runner-logs/runner-2-stdout.log \
        ~/.github-runner-logs/runner-3-stdout.log

# Stop one runner
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.github.runner-1 || true

# Start one runner
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.runner-1.plist

# Restart all three runners
for i in 1 2 3; do
  sudo launchctl bootout system/com.github.runner-${i} || true
  sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.runner-${i}.plist
done

# Stop all three
for i in 1 2 3; do
  sudo launchctl bootout system/com.github.runner-${i} || true
done

# Uninstall daemon services
for i in 1 2 3; do
  sudo launchctl bootout system/com.github.runner-${i} || true
  sudo rm -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.runner-${i}.plist
done
```

LaunchAgent mode:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do
  launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.runner-${i}.plist || true
  launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.runner-${i}.plist
done
```

Notes:
- LaunchDaemon mode is resilient to reboot without login.
- LaunchAgent mode requires user login after reboot.
- The wrapper includes a failure circuit breaker to avoid tight crash loops:
  default threshold=5 failures in 600s, cooldown=180s, then automatic resume.
- Tune via launchd environment variables:
  `GH_WRAPPER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, `GH_WRAPPER_FAILURE_WINDOW_SEC`,
  `GH_WRAPPER_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SEC`.

Remove runner registration from GitHub:
- Use the Remove flow in GitHub Settings -> Actions -> Runners for each runner.
- If you still have machine access, use the remove command GitHub provides in that UI.

# Ubuntu / KVM Runners

These runners run every CI job inside a **single-use Ubuntu 24.04 VM** managed by
[Tart](https://tart.run). When a job finishes, the VM is destroyed and the next
job gets a fresh clone of a golden image. Because the guests boot with nested
virtualization enabled, `/dev/kvm` is available inside the job — ideal for
workloads that themselves spin up VMs.

These runners are **additive**: they register as separate runners and coexist
with the macOS / AVF runners above.

## Scripts

- `bootstrap-tart-runners.sh`: bakes the golden image (if needed) and installs one launchd service per runner.
- `tart-bake-ubuntu.sh`: builds the golden Ubuntu 24.04 image with the runner + KVM pre-installed.
- `tart-runner-loop.sh`: endless single-use ephemeral runner loop (clone → run one job → destroy).
- `tart-github-app-token.sh`: mints short-lived runner registration tokens from a GitHub App.
- `tart-common.sh`: shared helpers/defaults sourced by the above (not run directly).

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Golden image\ngha-ubuntu-kvm] -->|clone| B[Ephemeral VM]
    B -->|tart run --nested| C[Boot Ubuntu 24.04]
    C -->|mint token via GitHub App| D[config.sh --ephemeral]
    D -->|run.sh| E[Run ONE job]
    E -->|tart stop + delete| F[Destroy VM]
    F -->|loop| A
```

One `tart-runner-loop.sh` process == one concurrent runner. `bootstrap-tart-runners.sh`
launches N of them under launchd.

## Requirements

- **Hardware/OS:** Apple Silicon **M3 or M4** running **macOS 15 (Sequoia) or
  later**. Nested virtualization is gated to this combination and to **Linux
  guests only** — see the [Tart FAQ](https://tart.run/faq/#nested-virtualization-support).
  The inner KVM is arm64-only (no x86 guests).
- **Host tooling:** [`tart`](https://tart.run), `curl`, `openssl`, `jq`,
  `sshpass` (used once during the bake), and `ssh`/`ssh-keygen`.

  ```bash
  brew install cirruslabs/cli/tart jq
  brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass   # or any sshpass formula
  ```

- A **GitHub App** for token minting (see below). We deliberately avoid
  long-lived PATs and never store a registration token on disk.

## 1) Create the GitHub App

The runners authenticate as a GitHub App. The host holds only the App's private
key; each VM boot mints a fresh, short-lived registration token.

1. Go to **GitHub → Settings**:
   - For a **repository/personal** target: your user **Settings → Developer
     settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**.
   - For an **organization** target: **Org Settings → Developer settings →
     GitHub Apps → New GitHub App** (so the org owns the App).
2. Fill in:
   - **GitHub App name:** anything unique, e.g. `my-tart-runners`.
   - **Homepage URL:** anything (e.g. your repo URL).
   - **Webhook:** untick **Active** (we don't need webhooks).
3. Set **Permissions**:
   - **Repository target:** Repository permissions → **Administration: Read &
     write** (required to create runner registration tokens).
   - **Organization target:** Organization permissions → **Self-hosted runners:
     Read & write**.
4. Under **Where can this GitHub App be installed?** choose **Only on this
   account**.
5. Click **Create GitHub App**.
6. On the App's page, note the **App ID** (top of the page).
7. Scroll to **Private keys → Generate a private key**. This downloads a
   `.pem` file. **Store it securely** (e.g. `~/.config/github-runner-tart/app.private-key.pem`,
   `chmod 600`). Never commit it.
8. Click **Install App** (left sidebar) → install it on the account, and select
   the repository (or **All repositories**) / organization you want runners for.

You now have an **App ID** and a **private key `.pem`** — that's all the host
needs.

## 2) Bake the golden image (first run, ~once)

`bootstrap-tart-runners.sh` does this automatically on first run, but you can do
it explicitly:

```bash
bash tart-bake-ubuntu.sh
# options: --golden-image <name> --base-image <ref> --runner-version <x.y.z>
#          --cpus <n> --memory-mb <mb> --disk-gb <gb> --force
```

This:
- generates a dedicated SSH keypair at `~/.config/github-runner-tart/id_ed25519`
  (reused on subsequent bakes),
- clones `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/ubuntu:latest` (Ubuntu 24.04) into `gha-ubuntu-kvm`,
- boots it with `--nested`, injects the key, installs the Actions runner and its
  dependencies, **verifies `/dev/kvm` with `kvm-ok`** (the bake fails if nested
  KVM is unavailable), then disables password SSH and shuts down.

> Note: the cirruslabs base image ships with well-known `admin`/`admin`
> credentials. They are used **only once** during the bake to inject our key;
> password authentication is then turned off inside the golden image.

## 3) One command: bootstrap + launchd (LaunchDaemon recommended)

Recommended (system LaunchDaemons, survives reboot without login):

```bash
sudo bash bootstrap-tart-runners.sh \
  --count 3 \
  --org your-org \
  --app-id 123456 \
  --private-key "$HOME/.config/github-runner-tart/app.private-key.pem" \
  --cpus 2 \
  --memory-mb 4096 \
  --disk-gb 50 \
  --install-launchd \
  --launchd-scope daemon \
  --launchd-user "$USER"
```

Interactive-user mode (LaunchAgents; starts after user login):

Repository target:

```bash
bash bootstrap-tart-runners.sh \
  --count 2 \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --app-id 123456 \
  --private-key "$HOME/.config/github-runner-tart/app.private-key.pem" \
  --install-launchd
```

Organization target:

```bash
bash bootstrap-tart-runners.sh \
  --count 4 \
  --org your-org \
  --app-id 123456 \
  --private-key "$HOME/.config/github-runner-tart/app.private-key.pem" \
  --install-launchd
```

The only custom label by default is `kvm`. GitHub automatically adds
`self-hosted`, `Linux`, and `ARM64`; neither bootstrap disables these default
labels. Labels are case-insensitive. Request the OS, architecture, and capability
explicitly in workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, Linux, ARM64, kvm]
```

GitHub matches **all labels requested by the job**, not the runner's full label
set. Extra runner labels do not restrict which jobs it can accept: a job asking
only for `self-hosted` or `Linux` can still match these runners. Omitting `ARM64`
or `kvm` can also allow a job onto a runner without that architecture or
capability. Labels are routing metadata, not an access-control boundary.

Do not add GitHub-hosted image labels such as `ubuntu-24.04` to these runners.
A bare `runs-on: ubuntu-24.04` can otherwise match an ARM64 Tart runner instead
of the intended GitHub-hosted x64 environment. The guest remains Ubuntu 24.04;
removing that label does not change its OS or installed tools.

Common flags:
- `--count <N>`: number of concurrent ephemeral runners.
- `--golden-image <name>`: golden image name (default `gha-ubuntu-kvm`).
- `--base-image <ref>`: base OCI image (default `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/ubuntu:latest`).
- `--runner-version <x.y.z>`: pin the Actions runner version baked in.
- `--cpus <n>`: set guest vCPU count in the baked image.
- `--memory-mb <mb>`: set guest RAM in MB in the baked image.
- `--disk-gb <gb>`: set guest disk size in GB in the baked image.
- `--labels <csv>`: replace the custom label list (default `kvm`), not GitHub's automatic labels. Keep `kvm` when adding other custom labels for KVM jobs. `TART_RUNNER_LABELS` sets the environment default; the CLI flag takes precedence.
- `--name-prefix <prefix>`: runner name prefix (default `tart-ubuntu`).
- `--rebuild-image`: force a rebuild of the golden image.
- `--install-launchd`: install/reload a launchd service per runner.
- `--launchd-scope <agent|daemon>`: choose LaunchAgent (user login required) or LaunchDaemon (starts at boot).
- `--launchd-user <user>`: account used by daemon scope (sets `UserName` in plist).
- `--launchd-dir <dir>`: plist directory override.
- `--launchd-label-prefix <p>`: launchd label prefix (default `com.github.tart-runner`).

Hardening defaults (in `tart-common.sh`):
- SSH keepalive/fail-fast to avoid stuck loops after dead guests.
- Automatic cleanup of stale host-side `tart run` processes.
- Failure circuit breaker: if a runner sees repeated failures (default: 3 in 600s), it cools down for 180s, then resumes automatically.

### Persistent build cache (virtio-fs)

Each ephemeral guest is destroyed after one job, so without help every job
rebuilds from scratch. To keep compiler/dependency caches warm, the runner loop
shares a **persistent host directory into every guest over virtio-fs**:

- Host side: `~/.cache/github-runner-tart/runner-<N>/` (override the root with
  `TART_CACHE_DIR`). The bootstrap script pre-creates it and bakes the path into
  each launchd plist. It is shared in via `tart run --dir=ci-cache:<path>`.
- Guest side: Apple's Virtualization framework exposes every `--dir` share under
  a single automount tag (`com.apple.virtio-fs.automount`), with each named
  share as a sub-directory. The loop mounts that tag at `/var/cache/ci`, so the
  cache lives at `/var/cache/ci/ci-cache/` (best-effort; a mount failure is
  non-fatal and never fails the job). `SCCACHE_DIR=/var/cache/ci/ci-cache/sccache`
  and `SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE` are exported into the runner environment, so once a
  workflow enables [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) the cache is
  automatically persistent and **network-free** — no GitHub cache upload/download.

This is transparent to the workflow YAML: jobs just see a populated
`SCCACHE_DIR`. It complements (does not replace) `Swatinem/rust-cache`; it
deliberately only provides the sccache layer to avoid fighting that action over
`CARGO_HOME`/`target`.

**Concurrency (multiple runners):** each runner index gets its **own** cache
sub-directory (`runner-<N>`), so two runners never write to the same cache dir.
This is intentional — sccache/cargo are not safe with multiple independent
writers sharing one directory over virtio-fs, so per-runner dirs avoid cache
corruption at the cost of a little disk and a lower cross-runner hit rate. Tune
the cap with `TART_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` (default `20G`).

## 4) Verify

LaunchDaemon mode:

```bash
sudo launchctl print system/com.github.tart-runner-1
sudo launchctl print system/com.github.tart-runner-2
sudo launchctl print system/com.github.tart-runner-3
tail -f ~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-1-stdout.log
```

Daemon ops cheat sheet:

```bash
# Status (all configured Tart runner daemons)
for i in 1 2 3; do
  sudo launchctl print system/com.github.tart-runner-${i} >/dev/null 2>&1 \
    && echo "runner-${i}: loaded" \
    || echo "runner-${i}: missing"
done

# Full status dump for one daemon
sudo launchctl print system/com.github.tart-runner-1

# Tail stdout/stderr for one runner
tail -f ~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-1-stdout.log
tail -f ~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-1-stderr.log

# Tail all runner stdout logs together
tail -f ~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-1-stdout.log \
        ~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-2-stdout.log \
        ~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-3-stdout.log

# Show current VM state (golden + active clones)
tart list | grep -E 'gha-ubuntu-kvm|gha-ubuntu-kvm-runner-'
```

LaunchAgent mode:

```bash
launchctl list com.github.tart-runner-1
launchctl list com.github.tart-runner-2
```

You should see clone → boot → "Listening for Jobs" → teardown on each cycle. In
**GitHub → Settings → Actions → Runners** you'll see ephemeral runners appear
for the duration of a job and disappear afterwards.

## 5) Run a loop manually (no launchd)

Useful for debugging:

```bash
bash tart-runner-loop.sh \
  --app-id 123456 \
  --private-key "$HOME/.config/github-runner-tart/app.private-key.pem" \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --golden-image gha-ubuntu-kvm \
  --index 1
```

## Restart / Stop / Uninstall (Ubuntu / KVM runners)

LaunchDaemon mode:

```bash
# Stop one runner daemon
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.github.tart-runner-1

# Start one runner daemon
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.tart-runner-1.plist

# Restart runners 1..N (example 1..3)
for i in 1 2 3; do
  sudo launchctl bootout system/com.github.tart-runner-${i} || true
  sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.tart-runner-${i}.plist
done

# Optional: stop/delete stale runner clone VMs before restart
for i in 1 2 3; do
  tart stop gha-ubuntu-kvm-runner-${i} 2>/dev/null || true
  tart delete gha-ubuntu-kvm-runner-${i} 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Remove services 1..N
for i in 1 2 3; do
  sudo launchctl bootout system/com.github.tart-runner-${i} || true
  sudo rm -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.tart-runner-${i}.plist
done

# Remove the golden image entirely
tart delete gha-ubuntu-kvm
```

LaunchAgent mode:

```bash
for i in 1 2; do
  launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.tart-runner-${i}.plist || true
  rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.tart-runner-${i}.plist
done
```

Ephemeral runners deregister themselves automatically (they are configured with
`--ephemeral`), so there's normally nothing to clean up in the GitHub UI.

## Troubleshooting

- **Quick monitor workflow (auto snapshot on first crash):**

  ```bash
  # Watch all 3 runners; on first error marker it auto-captures and exits.
  ./monitor-tart-debug.sh auto all 200
  
  # Same, but only for runner 1.
  ./monitor-tart-debug.sh auto 1 200
  ```

  The last number (`200`) is the number of lines per log section included in
  the generated snapshot file. Use a larger value for more context, or a
  smaller value for shorter snapshots.

  Other modes:

  ```bash
  # Continuous live stream (manual Ctrl+C)
  ./monitor-tart-debug.sh watch all

  # One-shot dump right now (returns immediately)
  ./monitor-tart-debug.sh snapshot all 200
  ```

- **`VZErrorDomain Code=1` / "The virtual machine stopped unexpectedly":** this means the guest process crashed at the Apple Virtualization layer (host-side), not just a workflow failure inside Linux.
  Enable deep diagnostics and keep failed clones by reinstalling the launchd services with:

  ```bash
  TART_RUNNER_DEBUG=1 \
  TART_KEEP_FAILED_VM=1 \
  TART_VM_LOG_LOOKBACK_MINUTES=15 \
  sudo bash bootstrap-tart-runners.sh \
    --count 3 \
    --org your-org \
    --app-id 123456 \
    --private-key "$HOME/.config/github-runner-tart/app.private-key.pem" \
    --install-launchd \
    --launchd-scope daemon \
    --launchd-user "$USER"
  ```

  Then inspect:
  - `~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-<n>-stdout.log` (loop flow)
  - `~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-<n>-vm-*.log` (raw `tart run` output, includes VZ errors)
  - `~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-<n>-vm-diagnostics.log` (host `log show` extract for Tart/Virtualization)
  - `~/.github-runner-logs/tart-runner-<n>-trace.log` (bash xtrace when debug is enabled)

  With `TART_KEEP_FAILED_VM=1`, failed clones are not deleted, so you can inspect their state with `tart list` and `tart get <vm-name>`.

- **`/dev/kvm` missing / bake fails at `kvm-ok`:** the host isn't M3/M4 on
  macOS 15+, or Tart was started without `--nested`. Nested virt is not
  supported on M1/M2.
- **Token minting fails:** check the App ID, that the `.pem` matches the App,
  that the App is **installed** on the target repo/org, and that it has the
  Administration / Self-hosted runners write permission.
- **Guest never gets an IP / SSH:** raise `TART_BOOT_TIMEOUT`; confirm the base
  image pulled correctly with `tart list`.

**Questions?** Check the logs in `~/.github-runner-logs/` — they're usually the source of truth.
